    The atomic unit of data exchange. Every service uses ContextUnit for consistent, traceable communication with full provenance tracking.

## Why ContextCore?

ContextCore is the **Source of Truth** for the entire ContextUnity ecosystem. It provides:

- **Protocol Consistency** — All services use the same ContextUnit protocol
- **Type Safety** — Pydantic validation ensures runtime correctness
- **Security First** — Built-in security scopes and ContextToken authorization
- **Observability** — Full provenance tracking and trace_id propagation

## Open Source First

ContextCore is the foundation of ContextUnity:

- **Apache 2.0 License** — Use it commercially, modify it, contribute back
- **Protocol Stability** — Changes trigger mandatory review across all services
- **Minimal Dependencies** — Lightweight kernel with zero business logic
- **Production Tested** — Used across all ContextUnity services
