## Why ContextRouter?

Traditional agent frameworks are tightly coupled to specific LLMs or data sources. ContextRouter breaks these dependencies by separating **Decision Logic** from **Technical Implementation**.

This means you can:
- **Switch providers instantly** — Move from OpenAI to Vertex to local Ollama without code changes
- **Scale independently** — Upgrade your vector database without touching agent logic
- **Test in isolation** — Mock any component for reliable unit testing
- **Future-proof your stack** — New models and databases plug in seamlessly

## Open Source First

ContextRouter is built for the community with transparency and flexibility at its core:

- **Apache 2.0 License** — Use it commercially, modify it, contribute back
- **Active Development** — Regular releases with community input
- **Extensible Architecture** — Plugin system for custom connectors, providers, and workflows
- **Production Tested** — Used in real-world applications handling thousands of queries
