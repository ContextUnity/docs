## Why ContextBrain?

ContextBrain is the **SmartMemory** layer that powers intelligent retrieval across the ContextUnity ecosystem. It provides:

- **Production-grade RAG** — Hybrid search combining semantic vectors with full-text indexing
- **Knowledge Graph** — Entity relationships and semantic connections for graph-aware retrieval
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — Security scopes ensure data separation across tenants
- **Sub-second performance** — Optimized for <1s retrieval, <500ms reranking
