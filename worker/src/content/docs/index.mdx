## Why ContextWorker?

ContextWorker is the **automation backbone** that powers background processing across the ContextUnity ecosystem:

- **Reliable Job Execution** — Temporal workflows ensure jobs complete even through failures
- **Direct Router Integration** — Import `contextrouter` package, call graphs via Python
- **Harvester Pipeline** — Automated data collection and transformation from multiple suppliers
- **Shared Queue** — Redis queue shared between Worker and Router graphs

## Core Components

### Harvester Module

Automated inventory aggregation from 15+ outdoor gear suppliers:

- **Fetchers** — HTTP, Email, and API-based data fetching
- **Transformers** — XLSX, CSV, and YAML data normalization
- **Scheduler** — Daily automated runs with configurable timing
- **Notifications** — Email alerts for failures and stale data

### Router Integration

Worker imports ContextRouter as a **Python package**:

```python
from contextrouter.cortex.queue import get_enrichment_queue
from contextrouter.cortex.graphs.commerce import build_commerce_graph
```

> Router is **not** an API service. It's a library that Worker imports directly.

Graphs run in Worker process or as separate consumers:
- **Gardener** — Product taxonomy classification (subgraph of Commerce)
- **Lexicon** — AI content generation (subgraph of Commerce)
- **Matcher** — Product deduplication (subgraph of Commerce)

## Open Source First

ContextWorker is built for the ContextUnity ecosystem:

- **Apache 2.0 License** — Use it commercially, modify it, contribute back
- **Temporal Integration** — Industry-standard workflow engine
- **ContextUnity Native** — Full integration with Commerce, Brain, and Router
- **Production Tested** — Running real-world harvesting and enrichment pipelines

### Configuration

ContextWorker uses environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Temporal
TEMPORAL_HOST=localhost:7233
TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=contextworker

# Database (shared with Commerce)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/commerce

# Redis (shared queue with Router)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Tenant
TENANT_ID=default
```
